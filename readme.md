### Docker container to deploy a Flask app

#Welcome to my Docker project, where I have built a container that deploys an html app using Flask. The app launches a database with fictitious data that is displayed on a webpage. This simple webpage allows you to upload a file that is stored in a volume in the container. This file (when correctly structured) is parsed by the app and the additional data is inserted into the table and displayed.
