This project builds a back-end database (using the well-known 'customer churn' data set) and uses a RAG archtecture to allow a user to submit natural-language questions that are answered with database-relevant SQL queries. The front end is built using Flask and is a simple input prompt that returns the results. A similarity search between the question (embedded with all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and a chromadb vector database is performed, and the results are used in an api call to tiny-llama, which produces the resulting SQL output.
