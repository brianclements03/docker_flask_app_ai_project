### Docker container to deploy a Flask app

#Welcome to my Docker project. 

I will be building on a previous project to update it to a full stack ai chatbot. 

The project is evolving but the goal is a docker container that will manage a front end, back end, all aspects of a RAG system to return LLM generated content based on proprietary data hosted on MySQL.
